# Rules

A rule defines a behavior when an event occurs.
A rule has a name, an event type and multiple conditions and actions.
The rule executes the actions only if all conditions are true and were previously false.

Example:
We define a rule, 
which heals the player (the action) 
when he kills another player (the event), 
but only if the killer is reloading (the condition)

Rule Structure:
A rule consists of multiple elements.

- `"Heal on kill"` is the rule name
- `PlayerDealtFinalBlow` is the event
- `Team1` and `Slot1` are parameter values
- `cond player.isReloading` is the condition
- `player.heal(100)` is the action

### Declaring a rule

```
rule "Heal on kill" PlayerDealtFinalBlow(Team.Team1, HeroSlot.Slot1) { 
    cond player.isReloading
    
    player.heal(100)
}
```

### Declaring Custom Events

```
event PlayerWeaponReloading(heroSlot: HeroSlot) by OngoingEachPlayer(Team.All, hero) {
    val player = by.player
    
    cond player.isReloading
    self()
}

rule "On Weapon Reload" WeaponReload(HeroSlot.Ana) {
    player.ability1Enabled = false
}
```
